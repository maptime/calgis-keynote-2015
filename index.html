<!--LYZI // INTRO-->
<div>Together we are the <em>co-founders</em> of <a href='http://maptime.io'>Maptime</a>.</div>
<div>What is <strong>Maptime</strong>?</div>
<div>Maptime is a <em>community of local chapters</em> formed around <strong>beginner-oriented teaching and learning</strong> about <em>open source geospatial technology</em>.</div>
<div>Maptime is meant to be <strong>accessible</strong> and is explicitly <em>beginner-focused</em>.</div>
<div>Let's <strong>unpack</strong> this.</div>
<div>1. <em>Community of local chapters</em></div>
<div>Currently Maptime has <strong>sixty chapters</strong>!</div>
<div data-bodyclass='chaptermap'></div>
<div data-bodyclass='mindblown'></div>
<div>Considering that Maptime is <em>just barely two years old</em>, this is <strong>kind of nuts</strong>.</div>
<div>2. <em>Beginner-oriented teaching and learning</em></div>
<div>Maptime is <strong>by beginners, for beginners</strong></div>
<div>Started literally as <em>time to make maps</em>...</div>
<div>... and grew into a <strong>huge learning community</strong>.</div>
<div>How? <em>Why?</em></div>
<div>Bold statements:</div>
<div>We are <strong>all</strong> beginners.</div>
<div>We are <strong>all</strong> teachers.</div>
<div>There are things we <em>know</em> and <strong>don't know</strong>.</div>
<div>There are <em>things to learn</em> and <strong>things to share</strong>.</div>
<div>We'll talk <strong>more</strong> about this.</div>
<div>3. <em>Open source geospatial technology</em></div>
<div>We prefer teaching with <em>open source tools</em> because they are <strong>accessible</strong>.</div>
<div>(They <em>don't cost money</em>.)</div>
<div>But of course open source has its <strong>challenges</strong>...</div>
<div>We'll talk <strong>more</strong> about this, too.</div>
<div>4. <em>Accessibility</em></div>
<div>This means a few things.</div>
<div>Empowerment</div>
<div data-bodyclass='cactus'></div>
<div><strong>Hard work</strong> to breed <em>conceptual understanding</em></div>
<div>Open to folks of <strong>all backgrounds</strong> and <strong>skillsets</strong></div>
<div><em>Creating</em> resources, <em>forking</em> resources, <em>building tools</em> around our communities.</div>
<div>We each do this because <strong>we love it</strong> and <strong>care about it</strong>...</div>
<div>... but we all have <em>different ideas</em> about the <strong>future</strong> of geographic education.</div>
<div>This is our <em>strength</em>.</div>

<!--ALAN-->
<div>This is why we decided to build our community around open source.</div>
<div><img src="images/rainbow.png">Open Source is amazing! (except when it's not)</div>
<div>Tools and data are there for you to use! For free!</div>
<div>You can see how it works! You can fix it!</div>
<div>But unfortunately...</div>
<div style="color: white; bgcolor: black"><img src="images/rainbow-gray.png">Open Source is also awful!*</div>
<div>(*sometimes)</div>
<div data-bodyclass='pushinbuttons'>Made by technologists for technologists</div>
<div>A community culture that is:</div>
<div data-bodyclass='grumpycat'>unwelcoming</div>
<div>competitive</div>
<div data-bodyclass='cats-sunglasses'>snobby</div>
<div>generally obnoxious</div>
<div>Writing and learning Open Source takes a lot of privilege.</div>
<div>It's a utopia! ...but mainly for white dudes</div>
<div>Maptime is fighting for the soul of open source.</div>
<div data-bodyclass='osm-sf'>OpenStreetMap: case in point</div>
<div><img src="images/sf_cityhall_editing_josm_pale.png">It can be complicated <!--...but getting better! We believe you shouldn't have to be an expert to contribute. It's supposed to be the map that _anyone_ can edit!--></div>
<div style="color: white"><img src="images/flames.jpg">It can be unfriendly <!--The community has some great people, but it can also be very unfriendly. There are constant flamewars on the mailing list, and if a newbie asks a simple question or makes a mistake when they start out, old-timers will jump all over them. That's not cool. It shouldn't be that way.--></div>
<div><img src="images/osm-berlin.png">Detail and quality: amazing!</div>
<div><img src="images/osm-berlin.png">Berlin<!--look: trees in a park! Street addresses! Other stuff! The power of open source!--></div>

<div>Diversity is central to Maptime's mission.  <!-- But it's hard work, and we could do better. Mention CoC here --></div>
<div>It's not just a task for the underrepresented. It's a task for everybody. <!--Those of us who are overrepresented... we've benefited a lot... it's our obligation to use our privilege to help open up the mapping community to more people.--></div>

<div style="text-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #000"><img src="images/CalGIS2015_logo_with_emoji.jpg"><em>Maps made by everyone</em><!--Making maps is powerful. I want maps that are made by everybody, that show everybody's points of view... not just people like me. And this means beginners, too!--></div>

<!--CAMILLE-->
<div>But what does that mean as an organizer?</div>
<div>Organize like a beginner</div>
<div>Some truths... </div>
<div><strong>1.</strong> Beginners make excellent teachers</div>
<div><strong>2.</strong> On ramps to open source are steep</div>
<div><strong>3.</strong> It’s easy to focus on a tool, rather than a concept</div>
<div data-bodyclass='sissyphus'></div>
<div><strong>1.</strong> How do experts approach concepts and content with a beginners mind?</div>
<div><strong>2.</strong> How do we level out the on ramps to open source?</div>
<div><strong>3.</strong> How do we promote problem solvers rather than software users?</div>

<div><strong>Beginner's mind (初心)</strong>
  <!-- Zen buddhism has a concept of shoshin or ‘beginners mind,’ which is a state of eagerness, and lack of preconceived notions. So many of our tutorials are created by beginners -- in order to craft a lesson as a beginner you: 1) acknowledge there’s a lot you don’t know, 2) remember with stunning accuracy every pitfall you came across because you just hit those painful barriers yesterday, 3) you’re empathetic to the student. --></div>
<div>Basically, that’s small ego, big empathy, high enthusiasm.<!--  As beginners when we were crafting the structure of Maptime we were battling with Github either for the first time or at least for the first time on an organizational level. We quickly learned the limits of the github wiki as a real time collaboration tool (it’s not), and had a truly painful experience where our entire Maptime organization on github was deleted by a well meaning, but frustrated, member. 
When we started Maptime we were absolutely beginners and everything was fresh, exciting, and possible, but now that Maptime is two years old (almost to the day!), we occasionally find ourselves proscribing certain ideas or tasks because either a) we have a workflow that works reasonably well, b) we’re t
--></div>
<div>what happens when you're no longer a beginner? <strong>organizer burnout</strong>
<!-- Organizer burnout is real -- you spend a lot of time making sure you have a venue, that your attendees can get access through the front door, that the projector works, and that the influx of 10-50 people isn’t disturbing your neighbors, and that you’re not taking the wifi down. On top of that, you’re concerned that the content you or your partner has prepared is good or interesting enough. Once you’ve organized a few Maptimes, you’re not longer a beginner, and you can lose sight of why you started it in the first place -- so how do you maintain a beginner’s mind as an organizer?  -->
</div>
<div><strong>1.</strong> Keep the beginners coming <!-- -- challenge the community or yourself to write lessons or tutorials on topics you aren’t masters of.
Change venues, change formats -- do a hack night or a show and tell, take a field trip. -->
</div>
<div><strong>2.</strong> Share organizing <!--  -- enlist a team, don’t try to do it alone, and don’t try to own it. --></div>
<div><strong>3.</strong> If it’s not fun anymore, stop. <!-- Let someone else take over. It only works if you’re having a go --></div>
<div data-bodyclass='sadcatparty'></div>
<div><img src="images/onramps.gif">level the ramps <!-- Open source is notoriously difficult to dive into. Open source just means that the blueprints are readily available, it doesn’t necessarily imply that contributing to the project, or even understanding it, is easy. Maptime is open source and we host all of our organizing tools, resources, and content on Github. Github is a platform that makes it easy to collaborate on documents and code, as well as host websites through Github Pages.  --></div>

<div>How?</div>
<div><strong>1. </strong> Keep it simple</div>
<div>Maptime is just a sketch of platform built with local materials <!-- Maptime is at heart just “a good idea.” Maptime SF is used as the sketch of a platform that’s been built with local materials all over the world. The only thing you need to start a Maptime is a venue -- you don’t need a maptime email address, a maptime github repo, twitter account, or meetup page. The only things we ask that you adopt from Maptime HQ is a code of conduct (which basically states, be kind and empathetic, and don’t try to sell anything). But if you want a website or an email account, we’ve made it as easy as possible to get them.  --></div>
<div><strong>2. </strong> Use the same tools and processes as major source projects like Node.js, Mapnik, and Leaflet.js</div>
<div>Hosted on Github
<!-- Like I said, everything is hosted on Github. Most major open source code projects are hosted on Github. It allows for the appointment of moderators or administrators who can guide contributions that come in the form of patched code submitted in a pull request, or submissions of bug reports in the issue tracker, and forums for discussion. If you’re unfamiliar with Github or this form of version control and you’re not experienced with code, diving into a more complex project is intimidating. By hosting our chapter websites on github as github pages sites, we’re providing some training wheels to the Git flow. -->
</div>
<div><strong>3. </strong>Engender ownership</div>
<div data-bodyclass='chaptermap'>Decentralized</div>
<!-- Maptime HQ or Maptime SF doesn’t own the other chapters. They control themselves. We’re here to just provide guidance, send stickers, and occasionally try to get all of us in the same room together. When someone has a good idea for changes to the main Maptime.io website, they’re encouraged to submit those changes. --></div>

<div>How do we promote problem solvers rather than software users?</div>
<div><strong>1. </strong>Make no mandates (with one exception)
<!-- 
This is something that Lyzi has spoken to, and Alan has/will speak to, but in terms of organizing and creating a learning environment, by emphasizing the community. We’re not a project hosted on github, we’re a community organized around learning. We also do not prescribe a curriculum.  Creating a balance of tutorials that gets to concepts as well as means of implementing them with tools has been a challenge. It’s much easier to organize around a Leaflet.js night than a ‘Javascript fundamentals’ night, especially when there are extensive documentation and guides written for a particular technology. --></div>
<div><strong>2.</strong> Seek diversity
<!-- I could teach Mapbox products and projects from now until Doomsday, and so as an organizer of Maptime SF, part of my role is making sure that we’re keeping a diverse series of workshops. Thankfully, that’s where Lyzi and Alan and Beth come in. That’s the diversity that keeps Maptimes from getting siloed in a particular technology. --></div>
<div><strong>3.</strong> Don't sell anything
<!-- But each Maptime has it’s own curriculum because each chapter has it’s own set of interests, expertise, and collective knowledge to draw on. The one recommendation we will make is to the Code of Conduct which condemns using Maptime as a platform to turn a profit, or a means of getting free labor for a for-profit project. --></div>
<div>be a beginner</div>

<!--BETH-->
<div>Amid this <em>success</em>, something else has become <strong>crystal clear</strong>.</div>
<div><strong>There is no road map</strong> to becoming a <em>geo expert</em>.</div>
<div>A definition:</div>
<div>Geo expert = <em>Open Source</em> + <strong>Esri</strong> + cartographic concepts.</div>
<div>Irony</div> 
<div><strong>We</strong> are <em>makers of maps</em>!</div>
<div>Maptime is an excellent <em>on ramp</em> into the world of <strong>maps</strong>.</div> 
<div>We've made this <strong>technology</strong> <em>easier to grasp</em>.</div>
<div>But <em>where do people go</em> once they get on the highway?</div>
<div data-bodyclass='hwy'></div>
<div>Some people, before they know it, have gone from <strong>beginner</strong> to <em>teacher</em>.</div>
<div><em>amazing!</em></div>
<div>But</div>
<div>Learning any craft takes <em>time</em>, <em>practice</em>, <em>focus</em>, and <strong>independent study</strong>.</div>
<div>Some students need more <em>guidance</em>.</div>
<div>Some students need more <em>structure</em>.</div>
<div><strong>That's ok.</strong></div>
<div>People come to Maptime as <em>adults</em>.</div>
<div>Being an adult is great!</div> 
<div data-bodyclass='adult'></div>
<div>But our brains have lost <strong>neuroplasticity</strong>.</div>
<!--<div data-bodyclass='old-dog-1'></div>-->
<div data-bodyclass='old-dog'></div>
<div>Learning new things <strong>just takes more time</strong> than it did when we were younger.</div>
<div>Still, picking up <strong>new technology</strong> can be <em>daunting</em>.</div>
<div>It's also hard to <em>really devote time</em> to learning a new skill in your off hours.</div>
<div>It can also be hard for a group of <em>volunteers</em> to offer even more time to help.</div>
<div>I would love to see a more <strong>sustainable solution</strong> to in-depth OS GIS education.</div>
<div>What if some of our <em>volunteer teachers</em> <strong>got paid</strong>?</div>
<div>What if <em>OS geo tools</em> were integrated into <strong>GIS certifications</strong>?</div>
<div>What if you could learn <em>spatial analysis</em> through <strong>QGIS</strong> <i>and</i> <strong>ArcGIS?</strong></div>
<div>What if <em>coding</em> and <em>design</em> principles were taught alongside <strong>cartographic</strong> ones?</div>
<div>What if there was a <em>code school</em> focused on OS Geo?</div> 
<div data-bodyclass='mindblown'></div>
<div>These are, admittedly, <em>big questions</em>.</div>
<div>I bet <strong>I'm not the only one</strong> asking them.</div>
<div>When I think about the future of geo education, and the path to get there, these are the ones I'm asking.</div>
<div>They are ones that make me think about the current <strong>education revolution</strong>.</div>
<div>They make me think about the <em>future of academia</em>.</div>
<div>#daunting</div>
<div>Managing Maptime is like <strong>moving pebbles</strong>.</div>
<div>Changing academia is like <strong>moving a boulder</strong>.</div>
<div><strong>Pebbles</strong> come with their own challenges, but <em>boulders</em> are tough.</div>


<!--LYZI + CONCLUSION-->
<div><em>Maptime</em> is for <strong>all of us</strong>.</div>
<div>Think about the last time you talked to a coworker, explaining to her <em>what</em> you do and <em>how</em> you do it.</div>
<div>Think about giving a <strong>cartography review</strong>.</div>
<div>Think about someone you met <em>this week</em> – did you tell them what you do? You probably <strong>taught</strong> them something new.</div>
<div>Something they didn’t know before.</div>
<div>Thats <em>teaching</em>.</div>
<div>We are all teachers.</div>
<div>And we are all building <strong>implicit learning communties</strong> all the time -- at <em>home</em>, in our <em>offices</em>, on the <em>train</em> during our evening commute</div>
<div>verbally, nonverbally, intentionally and unintentionally.</div>
<div>Maptime is just a <strong>formalization</strong> of these implicit communities.</div> 
<div>It’s not education by happenstance, but by intention.</div>
<div>It’s the realization that we’re all <strong>teaching</strong> and <em>learning</em> all the time, and we can hone those experiences to meet our goals. That’s the nutshell.</div>
<div>This is why we need <em>you</em>.</div>
<div>Think about <em>your</em> GIS learning experience. Was it <strong>hard</strong>?</div>
<div>It definitely was for me.</div>
<div>GIS is the marriage of something <em>totally technical</em> with something <strong>totally creative</strong>.</div>
<div>It's <em>geometry</em> and <strong>design</strong> and <em>databases</em> and <strong>statistics</strong> and <em>user experience</em> and <strong>psychology</strong>.</div>
<div>Maps are <em>ancient</em> and <strong>complex</strong>.</div>
<div>That knowledge is <em>so valuable</em> to folks <strong>just getting started</strong> with mapping.</div>
<div>Maptime suceeds because of a <em>diversity of skillls</em>, a <strong>diversity of strengths</strong>, and a <em>departure from ego</em>.</div>
<div>This community is built by its members.</div> 
<div>Every chapter changes the game.</div> 
<div>Every new member provides new insights.</div> 
<div>Every individual perspective changes the perspective of the whole.</div> 
<div>Geospatial expertise is <em>so valuable</em>, especially for mapping newcomers.</div> 
<div>If you think you shouldn’t go to Maptime because you can’t code, <strong>you are mistaken</strong>!</div> 
<div>If you think you shouldn’t start a chapter because you aren’t an expert, <strong>you’re in the wrong</strong>!</div>
<div>There's a geo beginner at Maptime waiting to learn and teach with you.</div>
<div>Teaching and learning.</div>
<div>That's what Maptime is for.</div>
<div>Let's talk, and see how we can help each other, together.</div>
<div>Thank you!</div>

<!--What is next for Maptime? We don’t really know. And that’s amazing!  That’s where we are. We intentionally pick things to teach we don’t know about just so we can learn.  You have skills and knowledge. You’re hungry for more. aptime is here for you -- both in practice and in idea. At very least, try to start noticing when you’re teaching and learning throughout your day. I imagine it’ll surprise you.-->
